Imaging shallow seismic structure can help better assessment of earthquake-induced ground-shaking, more accurate construction of seismic models at depth and
revealing regional geological complexiticity. A 3D Vsv shallow model extending to 8 km was constrained with the joint inversion of Rayleigh wave ellipticity
and receiver function in this study.

The grey dashed lines enclose Tibet area and the solid circles are indicative of uninterpolated average Vsv over this depth range beneath seismic stations.">}}
